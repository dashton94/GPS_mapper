# GPS mapper

Summary: jupyter notebook (python 3) which showcases methods including: accessing the Strava API, data handling in pandas, large-scale geospatial mapping using folium, and data visulisations/projections in 2d/3d. Folium map examples are shown in a markdown as images.

Full overview: I have developed a script to extract GPS data from my runs which are uploaded to the popular fitness-focused social media app, Strava, before overlaying these data on maps which use the python package, folium, in order to recreate a global heatmap of my gps recorded runs. This code can be adjusted for the user's inputs and work similarly on new data. I additionally explore the gpx data of a single activity to highlight key geospatial information, including terrain profiling, before utilising Lidar mapping of the Isle of Wight to project this in 3d.
